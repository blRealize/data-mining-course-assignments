# Import the packages and classes needed in this example:
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create a numpy array of data:
x = np.array([6, 16, 26, 36, 46, 56]).reshape((-1, 1))
y = np.array([4, 23, 10, 12, 22, 35])

# Create an instance of a linear regression model and fit it to the data with the fit() function:
model = LinearRegression().fit(x, y) 

# The following section will get results by interpreting the created instance: 

# Obtain the coefficient of determination by calling the model with the score() function, then print the coefficient:
r_sq = model.score(x, y)
print('coefficient of determination:', r_sq)

# Print the Intercept:
print('intercept:', model.intercept_)

# Print the Slope:
print('slope:', model.coef_) 

# Predict a Response and print it:
y_pred = model.predict(x)
print('Predicted response:', y_pred, sep='\n')
